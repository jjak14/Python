# Zip-TranferT1FolderForRunDataSet
This project is about writting a python script to zip the T1 folder and move it for backup to a specific destination.
Doing this remove the need to go through multiple steps (opening folders, zipping folder, copy and paste, etc.)
2 differents scripts have been written. 
A test in production environment was not performed due to rights restriction
And adaptation for local test was made to the directory and was successfully ran.
Will improve and ask best practice for integration.
